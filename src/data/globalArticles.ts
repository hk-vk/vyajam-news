    content: 'In a bizarre incident in Florida, a man took things too literally and showed up naked at a gender reveal party, believing it was an event for everyone to reveal their own gender. Tim Roth, a US college graduate, thought it was a party where people revealed their current genders, "as everyone is changing their genders these days." The sight of him, especially in front of children, horrified everyone. His brother, who is a gender fluid person, also arrived naked, with makeup on half of his face and a beard on the other half. The police were called immediately, and he was arrested on the spot. His lawyer argued in court that the man was only guilty of being stupid, which is not a crime in the USA.'

    content: 'In a bizarre incident from North Carolina, a doctor, after two hours of rigorous surgery, removed a tumor from a patient\'s body only to put it back. Surgeon Mc Clover was disappointed with the patient\'s excuse of his card declining at the payment desk. So, he asked him to lie down on the bed for some "formality" and then put the tumor back in another two-hour-long surgery session. Not only this, but he also added the expense for the second surgery to his bill. The patient went to seek police help, where the police offered him something to drink to calm him down. When paying for the drinks, his card declined again, and he was taken into custody.'

    content: 'Following the implementation of a â‚¹25 per toilet tax in Himachal Pradesh, the Congress government has devised an innovative toilet seat-sharing formula. According to the new formula, people can save taxes by sharing a toilet. Two people can use it at the same time, facing opposite directions, or use it one after the other but flush only once, which will also save on the water bill. The President of the Congress Toilet Seat Sharing Committee said, "We want \'Muhabbat ki dukaan\' in Himachal. People will love each other more if they share the toilet together because \'sharing is caring.\'" In response to Congress\'s formula, Himachal Pradesh residents have devised their own free formula and have started open defecation.'
